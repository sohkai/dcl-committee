# Decentraland DAO Upgrades

Scripts to enact upgrades to Decentraland's DAO (an Aragon v1 DAO).

Each script generate one or more transactions, usually creating votes through the SAB for the desired change(s).

- [`2021-08-address-denylist`](scripts/2021-08-denylist.js): install a [`List` app](https://github.com/decentraland/dao-apps/tree/master/list) to act as an address deny/ban list
- [`2021-11-committee-remove`](scripts/2022-11-committee-remove.js): remove a committee member

## Run

```
node script/<file>
```

Environment variables:

- `NETWORK`: one of `mainnet` or `rinkeby`, defaults to `mainnet`
- `DEBUG`: if truthy, logs additional information about the script (i.e. calls script, etc).
